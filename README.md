# Standard File Server, Ruby Implementation

This is a production-ready reference implementation of the [Standard File](https://standardfile.org/) protocol.

A production client is available at https://app.standardnotes.org

### Running your own server
You can run your own Standard File server, and use it with any SF compatible client (like Standard Notes). This allows you to have 100% control of your data. This server implementation is built with Ruby on Rails and can be deployed in minutes.

#### Getting started

**Requirements**

- Ruby 2.2+
- Rails 5
- MySQL database

**Instructions**

1. Clone the project:

	```
	git clone https://github.com/standardfile/ruby-server.git
	```

2. Create a .env file in the project's root directory. Add environment variables (see Environment variables for full listing):

	```
	DB_HOST=localhost
	...
	```

3. Initialize project:

	```
	bundle install
	rails db:create db:migrate
	```

4. Start the server:

	```
	rails s
	```
